# CV generator made by Tam√°s Szirbucz

I created this project just to have a CV and practice ReactJS. Feel free to fork and customize it with source acknowledgement.

## Usage

* Fill up the json files under /src/data/ with your data
* Change the /public/me.jpg to your own picture.
* Run `npm start` from the root folder of the project
* Print the webpage into PDF. (OK, it's lame, I will implement PDF generation if I'll have too much free time :) )
