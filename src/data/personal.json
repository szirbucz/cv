        "I started my career as Software Engineer in 2008. I gained experience in several fields: embedded systems, compilers, IT security and web applications.In the past few years I worked as a Lead Java Engineer, where I had the chance to improve my management and leadership skills.",
        "I'm a freak of code quality and performance, therefore I always take care about testing and measurement, since what is not measured, can not be controlled."
